Team Leader:  Joe Gomez

## Customer Segment:
  Our customers are people of the age of 18 and up, who are active and outdoorsy. They are of all income levels, from the lower side as they might not be able to afford buying surfboards, wakeboards, paddle boards, canoes, or kayaks. To the higher side, where they just might not feel like owning, housing, maintaining, and transporting their own equipment. 

We are specifically and solely in the outdoor fitness and aquatic sports market. There are many people who exercise, compete in water sports, and those who just want to take something out on the water for relaxation and leisure.  Additionally, the surfing business will grow within a few years because surfing has become an Olympic sport for Tokyo2020.  We expect more people to visit the US to go surfing, and our project will be a great business opportunity.


## Value Propositions:

  This is an entirely new service that customers previously didn’t know they wanted or needed, because it wasn’t available. There is no similar offering.  We are allowing customers access to our surfboards, wakeboards, paddleboards, kayaks, and canoes on the waterfront.  This gets rid of the need to buy, house, maintain, and transport their own aquatic gear.  It allows them to save time and money. It dramatically increases our customer's accessibility to aquatic recreational equipment, with the added convenience of being right on the waterfront, and it is easy to rent.


## Overview of Business:
  We are the first, and only, water sport recreational equipment rental business. We are revolutionizing the way people rent water sports equipment. We are an online business that offers the equipment at the waterfront of most beaches, lakes, and rivers.  If we don’t have a kiosk/rack/locker at the waterfront you’re going to, let us know and we’ll transport the equipment to your location.  We offer a smartphone app so you can easily locate our kiosks/racks/lockers and make sure the equipment is available. We believe our customers deserve a convenient, easy, and hassle-free way to have fun.


Our initial line of products and service include surfboards, wakeboards, paddleboards, kayaks, and canoes. These are readily available and accessible from the waterfront, which are in electronic kiosks/racks/lockers. They will be able to select the piece of equipment they want to rent from their phones, or the screens on the kiosks, and purchase the rental. It will then be dispensed. A customer will be charged by the half hour.  We will have employees that provide the upkeep and maintenance of an item.
Within the next 5 years, our business is expected to grow in terms of the amount of kiosks/racks/lockers around the nation and how much equipment they hold.
