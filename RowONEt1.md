**customer segments: an organization serves one or several customer segments.**

•For whom are we creating value?

  -We are creating value for people who want to paddleboard, canoe, kayak, etc. and may not be able to do so. We provide a convenient and cost-effective alternative rather than the consumer having to buy, house, and transport it themselves.
  - In particular, we target the people in the east and west coast and near lake which are the ideal place for surfing.
  
**•Who are our most important customers?**

  -Generally people between 18-35 and those with lower income as they might not be able to afford buying a paddleboard, canoe, or kayak.
  
**•Which market segment(s) can make our organization successful?**

  -Outdoor Fitness and Aquatic sections. There are many active people who exercise or people who just want to take something out on the water.
  -Surfing business will grow within a few year because surfing become an Oylmpic sport from Tokyo2020. It expects more people visit the US to go surfing, and our project will a great business opportunity.

**•Do we target a mass market or a more specialized market niche?**

  -We target a niche market that has yet to be filled.

**•Do we serve multiple market segments with different needs and problems?**

  -No. Our organization looks at one market segment (Outdoor Fitness).

**value proposition: An organization seeks to solve customer problems and satisfy customer needs.
•What products and services create value for each customer segment?**

  -We allow customers to access our paddleboards, kayaks, and canoes on the waterfront. This gets rid of the need to buy, house, and transport their own aquatic gear. It allows them to save money and time.

**•What problems are we helping to solve?**

  -Expensive equipment to participate in these aquatic activites and we also tackle a major convenience factor.

****•Do we offer innovation, performance, customization, design, status, price, convenience, cost reduction, risk reduction?**

  -We offer innovation (there is not an organization that does this across the U.S.), price, convenience, and cost reduction.
